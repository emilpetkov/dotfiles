# Configuration files

Here are my personal configuration files for the Bash shell
as well as other tools I use daily like IRB, GIT, SSH, etc.

Set up the following symlinks:

~/dotfiles              -> dotfiles
~/.irbrc                -> .irbrc
~/.ssh/config           -> ssh-config
~/.gitconfig            -> gitconfig
