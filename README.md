# Configuration files

Here are my personal configuration files for the Bash and ZSH shells
as well as other tools I use like IRB, GIT, Ruby, Rails, etc.

Set up the following links:

~/dotfiles              -> dotfiles
~/.irbrc                -> .irbmrc
~/.ssh/config           -> ssh-config
~/.gitconfig            -> gitconfig
